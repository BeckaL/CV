## Full stack developer with a preference for backend: Recent graduate of Maker's Academy

I'm an Oxford philosophy and languages graduate with 5 years' public sector experience in various analytical and strategy roles - most recently as a Business Strategy Manager at Transport for London. 

My first love was excel (particularly building complex models). Becoming a developer was a natural progression on from this, and I'm now loving using my logical thinking skills to build web applications.

I enjoy solving problems with logic, a bit of maths and a lot of neat code.

## Skills

#### Analysis and problem solving

I'm an analytical thinker, and have enjoyed using maths and logic to solve business problems.

- I acted as a 'go to' data analyst for my team at TfL, conducting analysis on a range of topics including: fare evasion, diversity and inclusion, and large-scale investment decisions.
- I like breaking problems down, and solving them with code - [this](https://github.com/BeckaL/summer-of-code/blob/master/Week_2_boggle.py) is a programme I wrote in Python before Makers which generates all possible words for a randomly generated boggle board.
- At TfL I used data analysis to talk to managers about how to improve employees' experiences at work, to help them to make data-driven decisions.

#### Communication and teamwork

I'm an adaptive team player, and am able to step into a leadership role when needed, or allow team dynamics to play out naturally when not. I naturally want to steer conversations towards useful conclusions, resolve problems and ensure all team members feel valued and included.

- During group projects at Makers, I've naturally tended towards leadership roles. I've organised stand-ups and retros, sought and implemented feedback to make things better, and worked to keep morale high!
- I used my communication skills effectively for a range of audiences at TfL, including: presenting work to senior managers (Directors and Managing Directors) at TfL, running training courses for all levels of staff, leading project teams, and drafting briefings for the Deputy Mayor and high profile external stakeholders.
- I translated complex data analysis into simple business insights for decision makers.
