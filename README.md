## Becka Lelew

Full stack developer with a keen interest in back-end logic. Recent graduate of Makers Academy, a 12 week bootcamp teaching the fundamentals of coding. I enjoy solving problems with logic, a bit of maths and a lot of neat code!

5 years' experience in various analytical and strategy roles in the public sector. Through these roles, I developed a love of Excel, but a frustration with its limitations. Now ready to go on to bigger and better things, and for a new challenge.
